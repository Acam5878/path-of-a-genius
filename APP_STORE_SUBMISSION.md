What if you could learn exactly what Einstein, Da Vinci and Newton learned? Walk the same intellectual path with 200+ lessons from history's greatest curricula.
```

### Full Description

WHAT DID GENIUSES ACTUALLY STUDY?

Einstein learned Ancient Greek at 12. Newton mastered Euclid before Cambridge. Da Vinci dissected 30 human bodies to understand anatomy. Marie Curie taught herself physics from borrowed textbooks.

Path of a Genius recreates these legendary educational journeys -- so you (or your child) can walk the same intellectual path.

THE PATH: A COMPLETE CLASSICAL CURRICULUM

We have distilled centuries of genius education into one structured course with six stages:

STAGE 1: FOUNDATIONS
- Ancient Greek -- The language of philosophy and science
- Logic and Reasoning -- Think like Aristotle
- Latin -- The root of Western knowledge

STAGE 2: MATHEMATICS
- Euclidean Geometry -- The same proofs Newton studied
- Algebra and Calculus -- From basics to brilliance

STAGE 3: NATURAL SCIENCES
- Natural Philosophy -- Physics from Newtonian mechanics to relativity
- Chemistry -- Elements, reactions, and discovery
- Biology -- Life sciences and anatomy

STAGE 4: HUMANITIES
- Philosophy -- Ethics, metaphysics, epistemology
- History -- The context that shaped great minds
- Literature -- Primary sources and classics

STAGE 5: APPLIED SCIENCES
- Engineering -- Da Vinci's machines to modern marvels
- Anatomy -- The human body, illustrated

STAGE 6: MASTERY
- Advanced topics and interdisciplinary synthesis
