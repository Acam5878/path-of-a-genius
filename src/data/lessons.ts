Socrates asks: "τί ἐστι τὸ ὅσιον;"

3. Euthyphro: "Piety is what the gods love"
4. Socrates: "Do the gods love it *because* it's pious, or is it pious *because* they love it?"
5. This question remains one of the most important in philosophy

**The Euthyphro Dilemma:**
Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?

**3. Law of Excluded Middle**
A ∨ ¬A
"For any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true."
• Either it is raining or it is not raining
• There is no third option

**Fallacies of Relevance:**
1. **Ad Hominem** — Attacking the person, not the argument

   "Think of the children!"

**Fallacies of Ambiguity:**
4. **Equivocation** — Using a word with two meanings
   "The sign said 'fine for parking here,' so I parked."

5. **Straw Man** — Misrepresenting someone's argument
   "You want less military spending? So you want us defenseless!"

**Fallacies of Presumption:**
6. **False Dilemma** — Only two options when more exist
   "You're either with us or against us."

7. **Begging the Question** — Assuming what you're trying to prove
   "The Bible is true because it's the word of God."

8. **Slippery Slope** — A leads to B leads to disaster (without proof)
   "If we allow X, next thing you know we'll have Y!"

**Fallacies of Induction:**
9. **Hasty Generalization** — Too small a sample

**Deduction: General → Specific (Certain)**
• Premise: All swans are white

**Mill's Five Methods of Induction:**

1. **Method of Agreement**
   If A occurs in all cases where X occurs, A may cause X.

2. **Method of Difference**
   If X occurs when A is present but not when A is absent, A causes X.

3. **Joint Method**
   Combine Agreement and Difference.

4. **Method of Residues**
   Subtract known causes; what remains is the cause of what remains.

5. **Method of Concomitant Variation**
   If A varies when X varies, they're related.

**1. Division of Labor**
One worker making pins alone: ~20 pins/day
Ten workers, each doing one step: ~48,000 pins/day

"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour."

**2. The Invisible Hand**
"By pursuing his own interest, [man] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it."

Bakers don't make bread because they love you—they do it for profit. Yet you get bread.

**3. Free Trade Benefits All**
If Portugal makes wine better and England makes cloth better, both gain by trading rather than making both themselves.

**4. Self-Interest ≠ Greed**
Smith was a moral philosopher first. Self-interest channeled through markets and competition benefits society. Monopoly and cronyism do not.

**Key Quote:**
"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."`,

Less demand (curve shifts left): substitute goods, changing tastes

**Shifts in Supply:**
More supply: better technology, lower costs, more producers
Less supply: natural disasters, regulations, fewer producers

Mill: Quality matters. "Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

• Lower: bodily pleasures, simple entertainment
• Higher: intellectual pursuits, art, moral satisfaction
• Those who've experienced both prefer higher pleasures

**Applying Utilitarianism to Economics:**

1. **Progressive Taxation**
   The marginal utility of $1 is higher for a poor person than a rich one.

2. **Worker Cooperatives**
   Mill advocated for workers owning their businesses—more people share the gains.

3. **Women's Economic Rights**

Leonardo wrote: "The painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any reason, is like a mirror which copies everything placed in front of it without being conscious of their existence."

**Exercise 1: Contour Drawing (10 min)**
1. Place an object before you (hand, cup, plant)
2. Put pencil on paper
3. Look ONLY at the object—not your paper
4. Draw the outline slowly, following edges with your eyes
5. Your drawing will look strange. That's fine.

**Exercise 2: Negative Space (15 min)**
Don't draw the chair—draw the shapes *around* the chair.
• The triangle between the legs
• The rectangle behind the back
• Your brain stops labeling; you start seeing

**Exercise 3: Value Study (15 min)**

• Where is the brightest bright?
• Where is the darkest dark?
• Everything else is middle gray

    overview: "Leonardo's famous Vitruvian Man illustrates ideal human proportions. Understanding these ratios helps you draw figures that look natural.",
    content: `**The Canon of Proportions**

Leonardo's Vitruvian Man (c. 1490) shows:

**Head as Unit of Measurement:**
• Total height = 8 heads
• Shoulder width = 2 heads
• Torso = 3 heads
• Legs = 4 heads

**Key Proportions:**
• Arms span = height (forms a square)
• Navel is the center when arms/legs spread (forms a circle)
• Elbow = waist height
• Wrist = hip/groin height
• Hands = face length
• Foot = forearm length

**The 8-Head Figure:**
\`\`\`
Head 1: Top of head to chin
Head 2: Chin to nipple line
Head 3: Nipples to navel
Head 4: Navel to groin
Head 5: Groin to mid-thigh
Head 6: Mid-thigh to below knee
Head 7: Below knee to mid-calf
Head 8: Mid-calf to floor
\`\`\`

**Exercise:**
1. Measure your own proportions
2. Draw a stick figure using the 8-head system
3. Build forms (cylinders for limbs) around it

Note: Real people vary! These are idealized proportions.`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Body is approximately 8 heads tall",
      "Arms span equals height",
      "Halfway point is at the hips/groin",

    order: 4,
    overview: "Leonardo invented sfumato—the technique of softening edges to create lifelike depth. This is how the Mona Lisa's mysterious smile was achieved.",
    content: `**Sfumato: "Vanished Like Smoke"**

The Mona Lisa's smile is ambiguous because Leonardo blurred the corners of her mouth. Your brain can't pin down her expression.

**The Technique:**

Traditional approach: Hard edges
Leonardo's approach: No lines, only gradual transitions

**How to Achieve Sfumato:**

1. **Build in Layers**
   Apply thin, translucent layers (glazes)
   Each layer slightly modifies what's beneath
   Leonardo used 20-30 layers on faces

2. **Blend Continuously**
   Don't leave visible brushstrokes
   Use soft brushes, fingers, or cloth

3. **Edge Control**
   • Hard edges draw attention: eyes, jewelry
   • Soft edges recede: background, shadows
   • Lost edges: where form meets shadow

**Pencil Exercise:**
1. Draw two overlapping circles
2. Shade one with hard edges (stay in the lines)
3. Shade the other with sfumato (blend beyond edges)
4. Notice which looks more 3D

**With Charcoal:**
1. Apply charcoal broadly
2. Use a blending stump to soften
3. Lift highlights with an eraser
4. Build up darks gradually

Leonardo: "Shadows and lights should blend without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke."`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Sfumato means 'vanished like smoke'",
      "Blend edges gradually, not with hard lines",
      "Use multiple thin layers rather than heavy shading",
      "Practice with charcoal or soft pencil"

Leonardo wrote: "The painter who has a knowledge of the nature of the sinews, muscles and tendons, will know very well, in giving movement to a limb, how many and which sinews cause it."

**Leonardo's Approach:**

**1. Direct Observation**
Dissected bodies at hospitals in Florence, Milan, Rome
Made over 240 detailed anatomical drawings
Worked by candlelight with decomposing bodies

**2. Multiple Views**
Drew each body part from multiple angles
Cross-sections to show internal structure
"Exploded views" showing layers

**3. Function, Not Just Form**
Asked: How does this work?
Studied muscles, tendons, nerves as systems
Compared human anatomy to machines

**His Key Insight:**
The body is a machine designed by nature.
Understanding the machine = understanding the form.

**Exercise:**
1. Find anatomical reference images
2. Sketch a hand from 3 angles: palm, back, side
3. Note where bones create bumps on the surface
4. Observe how tendons move when fingers flex`,

**Major Divisions:**
• **Axial skeleton:** Skull, spine, ribs (80 bones)
• **Appendicular skeleton:** Arms, legs, pelvis, shoulders (126 bones)

**The Skull:**
Leonardo's skull drawings remain among the finest ever made.
• Cranium protects the brain
• Facial bones give structure
• Mandible (jaw) is only moveable skull bone

**The Spine:**
• 7 Cervical (neck)
• 12 Thoracic (ribcage)

• Sacrum & Coccyx (fused)

**The Ribcage:**
• 12 pairs of ribs
• 7 "true ribs" connect to sternum
• 3 "false ribs" connect indirectly
• 2 "floating ribs" unattached in front

**Key Landmarks for Artists:**
• Clavicle (collarbone) - surface visible
• Scapula (shoulder blade) - moves with arm
• Pelvis - determines hip position
• Spine curves: cervical (in), thoracic (out), lumbar (in)

    content: `**Understanding Muscles**

Leonardo: "All muscles have their actions not in a straight line, but obliquely."

**How Muscles Work:**
• Muscles PULL, never push
• Work in pairs: agonist (contracts) vs antagonist (relaxes)
• Example: Bicep curls arm up, tricep extends it back

**Major Muscle Groups:**

**Upper Body:**
• **Trapezius:** Upper back, moves shoulders/neck
• **Deltoid:** Shoulder cap, raises arm
• **Pectoralis major:** Chest, pulls arm across body
• **Latissimus dorsi:** Back, pulls arm down
• **Biceps/Triceps:** Upper arm flexion/extension

**Core:**
• **Rectus abdominis:** "Six-pack" muscles
• **Obliques:** Side twisting
• **Erector spinae:** Back straightening

**Lower Body:**
• **Gluteus maximus:** Buttocks, powerful hip extension
• **Quadriceps:** Front thigh, knee extension
• **Hamstrings:** Back thigh, knee flexion
• **Gastrocnemius:** Calf, ankle flexion

**Leonardo's Observation:**
Muscles change shape dramatically when contracted.
Draw the ACTION, not just the resting shape.

**Exercise:**
Flex your arm. Notice how the bicep bulges and tricep flattens.
Draw your arm in both relaxed and flexed positions.`,

    content: `**The Vitruvian Man (c. 1490)**

Based on the Roman architect Vitruvius's description of ideal human proportions.

**The Key Proportions:**

**Height = Wingspan**
Arms fully extended = height
This forms a perfect square around the body.

**Navel as Center:**
With arms and legs spread, the navel is the center of a circle.

**Specific Measurements (in head units):**
• Total height = 8 heads
• Face = 1/10 of height
• Hand = 1/10 of height
• Foot = 1/7 of height
• Cubit (elbow to fingertip) = 1/4 of height

**The Mathematical Harmony:**
Leonardo discovered the body exhibits the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618):
• Navel divides height at golden ratio
• Ratio of forearm to hand
• Ratio of face sections

**Why This Matters:**
• Universal proportions for figure drawing
• Reveals nature's mathematical order
• Renaissance ideal: human as microcosm of universe

**Exercise:**
1. Measure your own proportions
2. Draw a Vitruvian figure using the 8-head system

**Leonardo's Observations:**

**Homologous Structures:**
• Human arm = dog leg = bird wing = whale flipper
• Same bones, arranged differently
• Same blueprint, different functions

**Horse Studies:**
Leonardo made extensive horse anatomy studies
• Commissioned for massive horse statue
• Compared horse legs to human arms
• Noted similar muscle arrangement

**Bear Foot Study:**
Drew a bear's foot and compared to human
• Similar bone structure
• Bear walks on entire foot (plantigrade)
• Humans walk on toes (digitigrade running)

**His Insight:**
"There is a great resemblance of bones and muscles... 
from man to horse."

**Why It Matters:**
• 300+ years before Darwin
• Recognized structural unity of life
• Led to insights about function
• Still used in medical research (animal models)

• Built on Hero of Alexandria's automatons

**2. Observe Nature**
• How do birds fly?
• How do fish swim?
• How do plants grow?

**3. Experiment and Iterate**
• Build models
• Test ideas
• Revise based on results

**Key Mechanical Principles:**

**Leverage:**
A longer lever arm requires less force.
F₁ × d₁ = F₂ × d₂

**Pulleys:**
Each additional pulley halves the force needed.
Trade force for distance.

**Gears:**
Transfer and modify rotational motion.
Larger gear = more torque, less speed.

Leonardo: "A bird is an instrument working according to mathematical law, which instrument it is within the capacity of man to reproduce."

**His Flying Machine Designs:**

**1. Ornithopter (Flapping Wings)**
• Pilot lies horizontal
• Operates wing flaps with arms and legs
• Problem: humans lack sufficient power

**2. Helical Screw (Aerial Screw)**
• Corkscrew shape rotates
• Compresses air beneath it
• Precursor to helicopter concept

**3. Glider**
• Fixed wings like modern hang glider
• More practical than flapping designs
• Used cambered (curved) wing shape

**What Leonardo Got Right:**
✓ Birds use wings to push air down → lift
✓ Wing shape matters (camber)
✓ Tail controls direction
✓ Need to study air resistance

**What He Got Wrong:**
✗ Human muscles can't power flapping flight
✗ Needed power source (engine)
✗ Some proportions incorrect

**Key Insight:**
"The air next to a bird's wing is compressed...
this compression produces the force that lifts it."

**The Setup:**
• Dark room with small hole in shutters
• Beam of sunlight enters
• Passes through a prism
• Projects onto opposite wall

**The Discovery:**
White light splits into a spectrum:
Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue → Indigo → Violet

**Why This Matters:**
Before Newton: Color was thought to be added by prism
Newton proved: Colors are already IN white light

**Experiment 1:** Split white light with first prism
**Experiment 2:** Pass single color through second prism
**Result:** That color doesn't split further!

Red through prism → only red emerges
Each color is "pure" and fundamental.

**Newton's Conclusion:**
"Light consists of rays differently refrangible."

Different colors bend at different angles:
• Violet bends most
• Red bends least

**Key Term: Refraction**
Light bends when entering a new medium.
Different colors refract differently.

If you have a prism, recreate Newton's experiment.
Shine light through it and observe the spectrum.`,

    content: `**The Problem with Lenses**

**Chromatic Aberration:**
Lenses refract different colors at different angles.
Result: Color fringes around objects.
Stars have rainbow halos!

Newton realized: Every lens creates this problem.

**Newton's Solution: Use Mirrors**

**The Reflecting Telescope (1668):**
• Concave mirror collects light
• Small flat mirror directs to eyepiece
• Mirrors reflect all colors equally
• No chromatic aberration!

**How It Works:**
\`\`\`
Light from star
    ↓
[Concave Primary Mirror]
    ↓ (reflects back)
[Flat Secondary Mirror at 45°]
    → [Eyepiece] → Eye
\`\`\`

**Advantages:**
✓ No color distortion
✓ Can make larger (mirrors easier than big lenses)
✓ Mirrors can be supported from behind

**Modern Telescopes:**
All major research telescopes use mirrors:
• Hubble Space Telescope
• James Webb Space Telescope
• Ground-based observatories

**Newton's Original:**
• Primary mirror: 1.3 inches diameter
• Made of metal alloy (speculum)

    content: `**Newton's Rings**

**The Phenomenon:**
Place a curved lens on a flat glass surface.
Illuminate with single-color light.
Observe: Concentric colored rings!

**What's Happening:**
Light reflects from:
1. Bottom of curved lens
2. Top of flat glass

These reflections interfere:
• Constructive: bright ring
• Destructive: dark ring

**Why Rings Form:**
Gap between lens and glass varies.
At different distances, light waves add or cancel.

**The Puzzle:**
This looks like wave behavior!
Waves interfere; particles don't.

**Newton's View:**
Despite this evidence, Newton favored particles ("corpuscles").
He believed light had "fits" of transmission/reflection.
This explained periodicity without full wave theory.

**The Modern Understanding:**
Light is BOTH particle and wave.
• Photoelectric effect → particles (photons)
• Interference → wave behavior
• This is quantum mechanics!

**Wavelength and Color:**
Red light: ~700 nm wavelength
Violet light: ~400 nm wavelength
Ring spacing reveals wavelength.

**Exercise:**
If you have a magnifying glass and flat glass:
Press them together and shine light through.

    content: `**Calculus: The Mathematics of Change**

Newton's question: How do I describe the motion of planets mathematically?

**The Two Branches:**

**1. Differential Calculus (Derivatives)**
How fast is something changing *right now*?

Your car's speedometer shows the derivative of your position.
• Position: where you are
• Velocity: derivative of position (how fast position changes)
• Acceleration: derivative of velocity (how fast velocity changes)

**2. Integral Calculus (Integrals)**
What's the *total* change over time?

If you know your speed at every moment, integrating gives total distance.
• Velocity × time = distance (for constant speed)
• ∫ velocity dt = distance (for changing speed)

**The Fundamental Insight:**
Differentiation and integration are *inverses*.

Take a function → differentiate → integrate → get original function back

**Real-World Examples:**
• Biology: rate of population growth
• Economics: marginal cost/revenue
• Physics: motion, electricity, waves
• Engineering: optimization, control systems

**Definition:**
lim(x→a) f(x) = L

"As x approaches a, f(x) approaches L"

**Example 1: Simple**
lim(x→3) (x + 2) = 5
Just plug in: 3 + 2 = 5

**Example 2: Interesting**
lim(x→1) (x² - 1)/(x - 1)

If we plug in x = 1: (1-1)/(1-1) = 0/0 ← undefined!

lim(x→1) (x + 1) = 2

The limit exists even though f(1) doesn't!

**Example 3: The Famous One**
lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1

This limit is fundamental to all of trigonometry in calculus.

**One-Sided Limits:**
lim(x→0⁺) means approaching from the right (positive side)
lim(x→0⁻) means approaching from the left (negative side)

    content: `**The Derivative**

**Definition:**
f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

This is the slope of the tangent line at point x.

**Basic Rules:**

**Power Rule:** d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹
• d/dx(x²) = 2x
• d/dx(x³) = 3x²
• d/dx(x¹⁰) = 10x⁹
• d/dx(x) = 1
• d/dx(constant) = 0

**Sum Rule:** d/dx(f + g) = f' + g'
• d/dx(x² + 3x) = 2x + 3

**Constant Multiple:** d/dx(c·f) = c·f'
• d/dx(5x²) = 5(2x) = 10x

**Product Rule:** d/dx(f·g) = f'g + fg'
**Quotient Rule:** d/dx(f/g) = (f'g - fg')/g²
**Chain Rule:** d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))·g'(x)

**Example:**
f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 7
f'(x) = 6x + 2

At x = 2: f'(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 14
The function is increasing at rate 14 when x = 2.

∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C

where F'(x) = f(x)

• ∫x² dx = x³/3 + C
• ∫x dx = x²/2 + C
• ∫1 dx = x + C

    overview: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion—unless acted upon by a force. This was revolutionary in Newton's time.",
    content: `**Newton's First Law of Motion**

**Statement:**
"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon."
— Principia Mathematica (1687)

**In Modern Terms:**
An object at rest stays at rest. An object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity. Unless a net force acts on it.

**Why This Was Revolutionary:**
Aristotle taught: Objects naturally stop. Motion requires continuous force.
Newton showed: Objects naturally continue. Stopping requires force!

**Inertia:**
The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion.
• More mass = more inertia
• A bowling ball is harder to start moving than a tennis ball
• A bowling ball is also harder to stop

**Examples:**
1. **Car brakes suddenly** → You keep moving forward (seatbelt saves you)
2. **Tablecloth trick** → Plates have inertia; cloth moves, plates stay
3. **Space probe** → Once moving, travels forever without fuel

**Why Things Stop on Earth:**
Friction and air resistance are forces that slow things down. In space, there's (almost) no friction—objects keep moving indefinitely.

"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed."

**The Equation:**
**F = ma**
or equivalently: **a = F/m**

Force (N) = mass (kg) × acceleration (m/s²)

**Units:**
• Force: Newton (N) = kg·m/s²
• 1 Newton ≈ force to hold a small apple

**What It Means:**
• More force → more acceleration
• More mass → less acceleration (for same force)
• Force and acceleration point in the same direction

**Examples:**

**1. Pushing a Shopping Cart**
• Empty cart (10 kg), push with 20 N
• a = F/m = 20/10 = 2 m/s²

• Full cart (40 kg), same 20 N push
• a = 20/40 = 0.5 m/s²

**2. Weight vs. Mass**
Weight = mass × gravity
W = mg
where g ≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth

Your mass is constant; your weight depends on local gravity.
• On Moon (g = 1.6): You weigh 1/6 as much

**The Rule:**
When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

**F_AB = -F_BA**

**Key Points:**
1. Forces always come in pairs
2. The pair acts on *different* objects
3. They're equal in magnitude, opposite in direction
4. They happen simultaneously

• Your foot pushes backward on the ground
• Ground pushes forward on your foot
• You move forward!

• Your hand pushes water backward
• Water pushes your hand forward

**Rockets:**
• Rocket pushes exhaust gases down
• Exhaust pushes rocket up
• Works in space (no air needed to push against!)

**Gun Recoil:**
• Bullet pushed forward
• Gun pushed backward (recoil)
• Same force, different masses → different accelerations

**Common Misconception:**
"If forces are equal, why doesn't a horse and cart cancel out?"

**The Legend:**
Did an apple really fall on Newton's head? Probably not. But he did wonder: if gravity pulls apples down, does it reach the Moon?

**The Equation:**
**F = G(m₁m₂)/r²**

• F = gravitational force between two masses
• G = gravitational constant = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²
• m₁, m₂ = the two masses
• r = distance between their centers

**Key Features:**

**1. Inverse Square Law:**
Double the distance → force becomes 1/4
Triple the distance → force becomes 1/9
Force drops off rapidly with distance.

**2. Universal:**
Every mass attracts every other mass.
You attract the person next to you (but very weakly).

**3. Action at a Distance:**
Gravity works across empty space.
(Einstein later explained this as curved spacetime.)

**Why the Moon Doesn't Fall:**
It IS falling! But it's also moving sideways fast enough that it keeps missing Earth. The Moon is perpetually falling around us.

**Calculating g:**
At Earth's surface:
g = GM_Earth / r²_Earth
g ≈ 9.8 m/s²

This is why everything falls at the same rate!

Two triangles are **congruent** if they have the same shape and size—one can be placed exactly on top of the other.

**The Four Congruence Criteria:**

**1. SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

**2. ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**
If two angles and the included side of one triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

If all three sides of one triangle equal the corresponding sides of another, the triangles are congruent.

**4. AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)**
If two angles and a non-included side match, congruent.

Same angles = same shape, but possibly different size.
That's similarity, not congruence.

Given: AB = DE, AC = DF, ∠BAC = ∠EDF
Place △ABC on △DEF so A coincides with D
AB falls along DE (same length), so B = E
AC falls along DF (same angle, same length), so C = F
Therefore BC = EF, and all angles match.
△ABC ≅ △DEF ∎`,

    content: `**Circle Geometry (Euclid Book III)**

**Key Terms:**
• **Radius:** line from center to circle
• **Diameter:** line through center, touching both sides (= 2 × radius)
• **Chord:** any line segment with both endpoints on the circle
• **Tangent:** line that touches circle at exactly one point
• **Secant:** line that crosses the circle at two points
• **Arc:** portion of the circumference
• **Central angle:** vertex at center
• **Inscribed angle:** vertex on circle

**Major Theorems:**

**1. Tangent Perpendicular to Radius (III.18)**
A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.

**2. Inscribed Angle Theorem (III.20)**
An inscribed angle is half the central angle that subtends the same arc.

If central angle = 60°, inscribed angle = 30°

**3. Thales' Theorem (III.31)**
An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle (90°).

**4. Chord Properties:**
• Equal chords are equidistant from the center
• A radius perpendicular to a chord bisects it

**5. Intersecting Chords (III.35)**
If two chords intersect inside a circle:
AE × EB = CE × ED

**Inscribed/Circumscribed:**
• A circle *inscribed* in a triangle touches all three sides
• A circle *circumscribed* around a triangle passes through all vertices

Every triangle has exactly one of each!`,

• I served as both vowel and consonant (like our J)
• V served as both vowel and consonant (like our U/W)
• K, Y, Z were used only in Greek loanwords

**Pronunciation Guide:**

**Vowels (pure, not diphthongs):**
• A = "ah" as in father
• E = "eh" as in pet
• I = "ee" as in machine
• O = "oh" as in note
• U = "oo" as in rude

**Consonants (mostly like English, but):**
• C = always hard "k" (Caesar = KAI-sar)
• G = always hard (Gallia = GAL-lee-ah)
• V = "w" sound (veni = WEN-ee)
• R = rolled/trilled

**Diphthongs:**
• AE = "eye" (Caesar = KAI-sar)
• OE = "oy" (poena = POY-nah)
• AU = "ow" (laudō = LOW-doh)

    content: `**Mental Addition Strategies**

**1. Left-to-Right Addition**
Instead of right-to-left (like on paper), add from the left:
• 47 + 36: (40+30) + (7+6) = 70 + 13 = 83

**2. Making Tens**
• 8 + 7: Think 8 + 2 = 10, then +5 = 15
• 47 + 36: 47 + 3 = 50, then +33 = 83

**3. Compensation**
• 99 + 47: Think 100 + 47 - 1 = 146
• 198 + 56: 200 + 56 - 2 = 254

**Mental Subtraction Strategies**

**1. Counting Up (for close numbers)**
• 83 - 47: Count from 47 to 83
  47 + 3 = 50, 50 + 30 = 80, 80 + 3 = 83
  Total: 3 + 30 + 3 = 36

**2. Same-Change Method**
Add the same to both numbers:
• 83 - 47: Add 3 to both: 86 - 50 = 36

**3. Subtraction by Parts**
• 83 - 47: 83 - 40 = 43, then 43 - 7 = 36

**Daily Drill:**
Calculate in your head (time yourself!):
1. 28 + 45 = ?
2. 67 + 88 = ?
3. 123 + 89 = ?
4. 91 - 37 = ?
5. 145 - 68 = ?

    content: `**The Times Tables (Commit to Memory!)**

Quick patterns to spot:
• 9s: Digits always sum to 9 (9, 18, 27, 36, 45...)
• 5s: End in 0 or 5, are half of the 10s
• 11s through 9: Double the digit (11×4 = 44)

**Mental Multiplication Tricks**

**Multiplying by 5:**
• n × 5 = n × 10 ÷ 2
• 48 × 5 = 480 ÷ 2 = 240

**Multiplying by 9:**
• n × 9 = n × 10 - n
• 7 × 9 = 70 - 7 = 63
• 23 × 9 = 230 - 23 = 207

**Multiplying by 11:**
• For two-digit numbers: sum the digits in the middle
• 34 × 11: 3_4, middle = 3+4 = 7, answer = 374
• 72 × 11: 7_2, middle = 9, answer = 792
• 85 × 11: 8_5, middle = 13 (carry!): 935

**Squaring Numbers Ending in 5:**
• n5² = n×(n+1) followed by 25
• 35² = 3×4 = 12, then 25: 1225
• 75² = 7×8 = 56, then 25: 5625
• 125² = 12×13 = 156, then 25: 15625

**Multiplying Two-Digit Numbers:**
Use FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last):
• 23 × 14 = (20+3)(10+4)
• = 20×10 + 20×4 + 3×10 + 3×4
• = 200 + 80 + 30 + 12 = 322

    content: `**Plutarch's Parallel Lives**

**What It Is:**
Plutarch (c. 46–120 AD) paired Greek and Roman leaders to compare their virtues and vices. Each pair explores a theme: ambition, justice, courage.

**Famous Pairs:**
• Alexander the Great & Julius Caesar (Ambition)
• Demosthenes & Cicero (Oratory)
• Theseus & Romulus (Founders)
• Pericles & Fabius Maximus (Statesmanship)

**The Life of Alexander (Excerpts):**

"When Philonicus the Thessalian brought the horse Bucephalas to sell to Philip for thirteen talents, the horse seemed wild and unmanageable. Alexander, then a boy, said: 'What a horse they are losing, for lack of skill and boldness to manage him!' Philip was silent. Alexander approached the horse, turned him toward the sun (noticing the horse feared his own shadow), spoke gently, and mounted him. Philip wept with joy and said: 'My son, seek a kingdom worthy of you. Macedonia is too small.'"

**Plutarch's Method:**
• Character is revealed in small moments, not just great battles
• Virtue and vice are choices, not fate
• History teaches by example—positive and negative

• Models of excellence to emulate
• Warnings about corruption of character

**The Central Question:**
How did the greatest empire in history fall? 

**Gibbon's Thesis:**
Rome fell from internal decay, not external pressure alone.

**The Five Causes (Gibbon's Analysis):**

**1. Loss of Civic Virtue**
"The Roman legions were now composed of mercenaries who had no country to defend."
Citizens became passive consumers rather than active defenders.

**2. Christianity (Controversially)**
Gibbon argued Christianity diverted energies from civic life to the afterlife. "The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity."

**3. Overextension**
The empire grew too large to defend. Resources stretched thin.

**4. Economic Decay**
• Debasement of currency (inflation)
• Crushing taxation
• Collapse of trade

**5. Barbarian Pressure**
Not the cause, but the final blow. The Visigoths, Vandals, and Huns exploited Roman weakness.

**Famous Passage:**
"The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."

**Lesson for Mill (and Us):**
Every civilization carries seeds of its own destruction. Vigilance is eternal.

• Issue: Could the King rule without Parliament's consent?
• Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army defeats the Royalists
• 1649: Charles I executed—first time a king tried and killed by his own people

**2. The Commonwealth (1649-1660)**
• England briefly a republic under Cromwell
• Failed experiment: Cromwell became a dictator in all but name
• After his death, monarchy restored

**3. The Glorious Revolution (1688)**
• James II (Catholic) vs. Protestant Parliament
• Parliament invites William of Orange to invade
• James flees; William and Mary become monarchs
• Bloodless transfer of power

**4. The Bill of Rights (1689)**

• No taxation without Parliament
• No standing army without consent
• Free elections and free speech in Parliament
• No cruel and unusual punishment
• Right to petition the King

A syllogism has exactly:
• Two premises
• One conclusion
• Three terms (each appearing twice)

**Example (Barbara):**
Major Premise: All mammals are animals.
Minor Premise: All dogs are mammals.
Conclusion: All dogs are animals.

**The Three Terms:**
• Major term (P): appears in conclusion predicate
• Minor term (S): appears in conclusion subject
• Middle term (M): links premises, not in conclusion

**Valid Moods:**
Aristotle identified 19 valid syllogism patterns.
Names like Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio encode:
• A = All S are P
• E = No S are P
• I = Some S are P
• O = Some S are not P

**Why It Matters:**
• First formal logic system
• Shows valid inference forms
• Basis for mathematical proof

Often translated as "happiness," but means more:
• Living well and doing well
• Flourishing as a human being
• Fulfilling your nature/potential

**Why Eudaimonia Is the Ultimate Good:**
• Every action aims at some good
• Goods form a hierarchy (means to ends)
• There must be a highest good (or infinite regress)
• This is eudaimonia—desired for its own sake

**What Eudaimonia Requires:**

**1. Virtue (Arete)**
Excellence of character and intellect.

**2. Activity**
Not just having virtue, but exercising it.
"One swallow does not make a summer."

**3. A Complete Life**
Needs sufficient time and resources.
"Call no man happy until he is dead."

**4. External Goods**
Some luck required: health, friends, moderate wealth.

• Excess: Self-indulgence

**Finding the Mean:**

**1. Relative to the Person**
What's moderate for an athlete differs from a sedentary person.

**2. Relative to the Situation**
Sometimes more anger is appropriate, sometimes less.

**3. Requires Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**
No simple formula—judgment develops through experience.

**The Setup:**
Take any conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola).
Inscribe a hexagon (6-sided polygon) in it.

**The Theorem:**
Extend the three pairs of opposite sides.
The three points where they intersect are ALWAYS collinear (lie on a straight line)!

**Opposite sides of hexagon ABCDEF:**
• AB and DE → intersect at point P
• BC and EF → intersect at point Q  
• CD and FA → intersect at point R

**Pascal's Line:** P, Q, and R lie on a single line.

**Why It's Remarkable:**
• Works for ANY hexagon on ANY conic section
• Discovered by a 16-year-old!
• Leads to over 400 related theorems
• Foundation of projective geometry

Two players are in a game of chance.
The game is interrupted before either wins.
How should the stakes be divided fairly?

**Example:**
First to win 3 rounds takes all.
Player A has won 2, Player B has won 1.
How to divide the pot?

**Pascal's Solution:**
Count all possible ways the game could end.
Assign shares based on probability of winning.

Remaining scenarios:
• A wins next → A wins (1/2 of cases)
• B wins next, A wins after → A wins (1/4)
• B wins next two → B wins (1/4)

A should get 3/4 of the pot!

Either God exists or doesn't.
You must choose to believe or not (you can't abstain).
What's the rational choice?

• If God exists and you don't: infinite loss
• Finite gains/losses are negligible vs. infinity

ẋ (x-dot) for derivatives

**Why Leibniz Notation Won:**

**1. Suggestive of Operations**
dy/dx "looks like" a fraction.

**2. Integration**
∫ f(x) dx
The dx tells you the variable of integration.

**Key Rules in Leibniz Notation:**

**Differentiation:**
d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
d/dx(sin x) = cos x
d/dx(e^x) = e^x

**Integration:**

    content: `**What is a Wave?**

A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy.

**Wave Properties:**
- Wavelength (λ): Distance between peaks
- Frequency (f): Number of waves per second (Hertz)
- Speed (v): How fast the wave moves

**Wave Equation:** v = fλ

**The Electromagnetic Spectrum:**
Radio → Microwaves → Infrared → Visible → UV → X-rays → Gamma

All travel at the speed of light: c = 300,000 km/s

**Wave-Particle Duality:**
Light is both wave and particle! Depends on how you measure it.

**Interactive Problems:**

**Problem 1:** A radio station broadcasts at 100 MHz. What's the wavelength?
- λ = v/f = 3×10⁸ / 100×10⁶ = 3 meters`,

    overview: "Everything is made of atoms. The periodic table is the chemist's roadmap.",
    content: `**What is an Atom?**

The smallest unit of an element that retains its properties.

**Atomic Structure:**
- Nucleus: Protons (+) and Neutrons (0)
- Electron Cloud: Electrons (-) determine chemical behavior

**Atomic Number = Number of Protons**

**The Periodic Table - Mendeleev's Masterpiece (1869)**

**Organization:**
- Rows (Periods): Electron shells
- Columns (Groups): Similar properties

**Key Groups:**
1. Group 1: Alkali metals (very reactive)
2. Group 17: Halogens (very reactive non-metals)
3. Group 18: Noble gases (unreactive)

**Valence Electrons = Outer Shell Electrons**
These determine chemical properties.

**Interactive Practice:**

**Problem 1:** Carbon has atomic number 6. How many protons? Electrons?
- 6 protons, 6 electrons (neutral atom)`,

    order: 2,
    overview: "Atoms bond to achieve stable electron configurations.",
    content: `**Why Do Atoms Bond?**

Atoms want full outer electron shells (usually 8 electrons - the Octet Rule).

**Three Types of Bonds:**

**1. Ionic Bonds - Transfer Electrons**
Metal gives electrons to non-metal (e.g., NaCl).

**2. Covalent Bonds - Share Electrons**
Non-metals share electrons (e.g., H₂O).

**3. Metallic Bonds - Sea of Electrons**
Metal atoms share electrons freely.

**Diamond vs. Graphite:**
Same element (carbon), different bonds = different properties!

**Interactive Practice:**

**Problem 1:** Will NaCl form ionic or covalent bonds?
- Metal + Non-metal = Ionic`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Octet rule: atoms want 8 valence electrons",
      "Ionic: transfer electrons (metal + non-metal)",
      "Covalent: share electrons (non-metal + non-metal)",
      "Bond type determines physical properties"

    overview: "Reactions rearrange atoms to form new substances. Balancing equations ensures atoms are conserved.",
    content: `**What is a Chemical Reaction?**

Reactants → Products

Atoms are rearranged, not created or destroyed.

**Law of Conservation of Mass:**
Mass before = Mass after

**Types of Reactions:**
1. Synthesis: A + B → AB
2. Decomposition: AB → A + B
3. Single Replacement: A + BC → AC + B
4. Double Replacement: AB + CD → AD + CB
5. Combustion: Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

**Balancing Chemical Equations:**
- Count atoms of each element
- Add coefficients (never change subscripts!)
- Atoms must balance on both sides

**Example:** 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (Balanced!)`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Chemical reactions rearrange atoms, don't create/destroy them",
      "Five main types: synthesis, decomposition, replacement (2), combustion",

**1. Solid** - Fixed shape and volume
**2. Liquid** - Fixed volume, shape of container
**3. Gas** - No fixed shape or volume
**(4. Plasma)** - Superheated gas with free electrons

**Phase Changes:**
- Solid ⇄ Liquid: Melting / Freezing
- Liquid ⇄ Gas: Vaporization / Condensation
- Solid ⇄ Gas: Sublimation / Deposition

**Why does temperature stay constant during phase change?**
Energy goes into breaking bonds, not increasing temperature!

**Pressure Effects:**
- Higher pressure → Higher boiling point
- Lower pressure → Lower boiling point`,
